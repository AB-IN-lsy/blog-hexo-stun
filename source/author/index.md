<h2>My Story</h2>

<h3>An Undergraduate in AuLin College of NEFU</h3>


<p>
My major is computer science and technology. At present, I am a junior. I like to study code and develop servers. I enjoy the feeling of AC, which makes me embark on the road of ACM. I have not won a good place in the past large-scale competitions. I will strive to win a place in the next year.

At present, the goal of national scholarship has been completed and efforts are being made to go to Central South University.
